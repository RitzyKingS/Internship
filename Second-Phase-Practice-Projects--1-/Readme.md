# World Happiness Report Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze the World Happiness Report dataset, which contains information about the happiness scores of countries based on various factors. The dataset includes factors such as economic indicators, social support, life expectancy, freedom, trust in government, generosity, and more. The primary goal is to gain insights into what contributes to happiness and to create a predictive model for happiness scores.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Happiness Report. It contains the following columns:

- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Region`: The region to which the country belongs.
- `Happiness Rank`: The rank of the country in terms of happiness.
- `Happiness Score`: The happiness score assigned to the country.
- `Standard Error`: The standard error of the happiness score.
- `Economy (GDP per Capita)`: The country's GDP per capita.
- `Family`: The perceived social support in the country.
- `Health (Life Expectancy)`: Life expectancy in the country.
- `Freedom`: The degree of freedom in the country.
- `Trust (Government Corruption)`: The level of trust in the government.
- `Generosity`: The level of generosity in the country.
- `Dystopia Residual`: A calculated value for dystopia.
  
## Project Structure
The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
   - Exploring the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
   - Normalizing or scaling numerical features if needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Calculating summary statistics.
   - Visualizing the data through various plots and graphs to understand feature distributions and relationships.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Building and training multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression) to predict happiness scores.
   - Evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2).
   
5. **Model Comparison**:
   - Comparing the performance of different regression models to identify the most accurate model for predicting happiness scores.
   
6. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations to better understand the relationship between key features and happiness scores.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarizing the findings of the analysis.
   - Identifying which factors have the most significant impact on happiness scores.
   - Recommending the best model for predicting happiness scores.

## Conclusion
The project's final conclusion will provide insights into what factors contribute most to happiness scores, as well as which regression model performs the best for prediction. The conclusions will be based on the analysis and evaluation conducted throughout the project.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
